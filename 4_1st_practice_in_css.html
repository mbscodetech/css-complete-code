            Ibrahim Zadran | Afghanistan captain: This is my first time captaining
             Afghanistan. It's a double challenge for me, I'm trying to do well in the 
             next games as well. We have a wonderful side in the T20 format. Fazalhaq, 
             Azmat and we have good spinners. Unfortunately 
            Rashid is not playing and we have a replacement in Qais and Noor as well. 
            Mujeeb is not playing but we have good players. We will try to play positive
             cricket and don't need to think too much. We will try to come out to the
              ground with definite plans and a definite mentality. We will try to keep it simple.
               I always have a good partnership with Gurbaz. I was taking my time and I told
                him that one of us should go longer, till the 15th over. My role in the team 
                is the anchor role and I went till the last over which was my plan.
Muhammad Waseem | UAE skipper: Congrats to Gurbaz, he played an outstanding knock and took 
the game away from us. We have good talent, you saw Tanish is playing good. Nothing went wrong,
 he played a very good knock. Ibrahim played very well, I thought we would restrict them to 140 but
  they took the game away from us.
Rahmanullah Gurbaz | Player of the Match: Feel really excited. Dreamt of a 100 in a T20I so excited.
 My plan was to give strike to Hazrat and whenever I got a loose ball, my plan was to be in as wicket
  was not easy. The crowd supports us everywhere, they support both teams and that is the amazing thing. 
  Thanks to them and I hope they come for the next game. I have played good knocks but in T20s I can 
  say this one is a special one.
